# data

The data directory contains data used in the project. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

Data are downloaded from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data
